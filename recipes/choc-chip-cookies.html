    <h3>The crispy edges and pools of chocolate (thanks to using chunks rather than chips) put this cookie recipe at the top.</h3>
    <p>Out of all the chocolate chip cookie recipes I've ever had, this one is by far the best. It does require patience and a bit more steps than usual, but it's well worth it. What makes these cookies so great is the additional step of <em>browning</em> your butter rather than just using unmelted, softened butter. This gives the cookies a deeper, more caramelized flavor. Additionally, (and this is the most unsatisfying step) these cookies are so great because after the dough is made, it must rest in the fridge overnight. I know it sounds super tedious, and while you don't <strong><em>need</em></strong> to do it, it will make your final product taste a hundred times better.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>180g all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>200g dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>50g white sugar</li>
        <li>10g vanilla extract</li>
        <li>170g 50-70% chocolate, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>170g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>4g kosher salt</li>
        <li>4g baking soda</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and line two 13x9 sheet trays with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Melt butter on saucepan over medium heat, swirling frequently until you start to see brown bits on the bottom of the pan and it smells nutty. Remove from heat and allow to cool for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li> Mix in both sugars and vanilla extract and whisk for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the egg and egg yolks and mix again.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, kosher salt, and baking soda.</li>
        <li> Add the flour mixture to the butter-sugar-egg mix and fold with a spatula until <strong><em>mostly</em></strong> combined.</li>
        <li>Fold in chopped chocolate until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Cover bowl of cookie dough with plastic wrap and let cool in fridge overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove cookie dough from fridge and let thaw at room temperature for 1 hour, or as long as it takes for it to be scoopable.</li>
        <li>Scoop 1.5 ounce balls of cookie dough, placing up to 8 on a sheet, evenly spaced.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are crisp and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and optionally sprinkle cookies with flaky salt.</li>
    </ol>
