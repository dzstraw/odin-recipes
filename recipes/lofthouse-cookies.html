    <h3>The pasty, sugary ones we all know may be insanely addicting sometimes and absolutely disgusting other times, but these homemade versions are pillowy soft and not too sweet so that they can be enjoyed any time.</h3>
    <p>I never liked Lofthouse cookies because they taste incredibly American in the worst way possible, but I respect Stella Parks as an amazing baker who uses super creative techniques in order to achieve the best-quality baked goods. She did that in this recipe, where cake flour, egg whites, and heavy cream are used to make these very soft, cakey cookies. It's nice to have a stand mixer for this recipe, but you don't need one.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Frosting</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ounces powdered sugar (2 1/2 cups; 285g)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (1g)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 ounces heavy cream (shy 1/3 cup; 70g)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cookie Dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces unsalted butter (2 sticks; 225g), pliable but cool, about 60°F (16°C)</li>
        <li>7 ounces sugar (1 cup; 200g)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons (5g) kosher salt</li>
        <li>ounces egg white (1/4 cup; 55g), from about 2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 ounce heavy cream (2 tablespoons; 30g)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons (10ml) vanilla extract</li>
        <li>11 ounces bleached cake flour (2 3/4 cups; 310g), such as Swans Down</li>
        <li>Assorted food coloring, nonpareils, and sprinkles, for decorating (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the Frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine powdered sugar, salt, cream, and vanilla. Mix at low speed to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until creamy and soft, about 5 minutes. Using a spatula, scrape frosting into a small bowl, or as many bowls as you would like colors, and cover with plastic pressed directly against the surface. Set aside until needed, up to 24 hours at room temperature.</li>

        <li>For the Dough: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Using the same bowl and paddle attachment used for frosting (no need to clean), combine butter, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix at low speed to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until fluffy, pale ivory, and soft, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk egg whites, cream, and vanilla in a glass measuring cup until homogeneous. With the mixer still running, add liquid mixture in 4 or 5 additions, pausing to scrape bowl and beater about halfway through. Decrease mixer to low speed, sprinkle in cake flour, and continue mixing to form a soft dough. Fold batter once or twice with a flexible spatula to make sure it's well mixed from the bottom up.</li>

        <li>Using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop, divide dough into 24 level portions and carefully drop onto 2 parchment-lined aluminum half sheet pans, leaving 2 ½ inches between each dough ball. If needed, pause to rinse scoop in hot water to ensure a clean release (misshapen scoops will spread into an irregular form). Bake until puffed and pale overall, but just barely golden around the very edges, about 15 minutes. Cool directly on sheet pans until no trace of warmth remains, about 15 minutes longer.</li>

        <li>To Finish: If you like, tint frosting with a drop or two of gel paste. Working with one at a time, dollop a shy tablespoon of frosting (3/8 ounce; 10g) over each cookie, spread into an even layer with a palette knife or butter knife, and top with sprinkles, if desired. Repeat with remaining cookies and enjoy immediately. Let remaining cookies stand at room temperature until frosting forms a crust, then transfer to an airtight container with a sheet of wax paper between each layer. Store up to 3 days at room temperature.</li>
