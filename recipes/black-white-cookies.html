    <h3>These are similar to the bakery ones, but are way fluffier and allow for more control over glaze flavor.</h3>

    <p>I've always really liked black and white cookies, especially when they used to have them at Starbucks, so I really like this recipe too. They taste cakey like the Lofthouse cookies, but are even fluffier and more giant with a more complex flavor from the chocolate icing.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Icing</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>4 to 5 tablespoons whole milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plus two tablespoons dark cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups (13 1/2 ounces) all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>14 tablespoons unsalted butter, cool, not cold</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the butter and sugar with an electric mixer (stand or hand held) until fluffy, about two minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing between each addition. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the flour in three steps, alternating with the buttermilk, added in two steps, mixing until just blended. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix in the vanilla and lemon zest.</li>
        <li>Line baking sheets with parchment paper, and using a 1/4 cup ice cream scoop, scoop the batter onto the pans, allowing about three inches between each cookie. You should get no more than six cookies per half sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies, one sheet at a time, for 17 minutes. The edges should be slightly golden, and the center should spring back when slightly touched.</li>
        <li>Cool the cookies on the pan on a rack for five minutes, and then remove from the pan and cool on a rack completely.</li>
        <li>To make the icing, mix the sugar, milk, cream, and vanilla. The icing should be spreadable, but thin enough to not look like cake frosting.</li>
        <li>Spread the vanilla frosting over half of the flat side of the cookie with an offset spatula. Let the frosting set for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chocolate to the rest of the icing and whisk. Add water, by the teaspoon, until you get a similar consistency to the vanilla icing. Spread the chocolate icing over the other half of the cookie. Let the icing set or at least an hour.</li>
        <li>These cookies are best served within 24 hours, but will keep for up to three days if kept in an airtight container at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
